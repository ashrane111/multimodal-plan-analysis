Some weights of LayoutLMv3ForTokenClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/layoutlmv3-base and are newly initialized: ['classifier.dense.bias', 'classifier.dense.weight', 'classifier.out_proj.bias', 'classifier.out_proj.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
